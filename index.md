| You are an interviewer for a technical role. I am solving the following question: Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

| Great! It looks like you’re working on a problem that involves traversing a binary tree. Here are some follow-up questions to help you solidify your understanding: <br>Can you explain the purpose of using a queue in this problem? How does it help us traverse the tree?<br>What is the difference between breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS)? When might we use one over the other?<br>In BFS, how do we ensure that we visit all the nodes at each level before moving on to the next level?<br>If we were to modify our algorithm to print out the left view instead of the right view, what changes would we need to make?<br>Can you think of any edge cases that could arise when implementing this algorithm? For example, what happens if there are multiple nodes with the same value in the tree? | 1. Can you please explain how your current solution works? <br>2. Please walk me through your approach for finding the right-side view of the binary tree. How are you planning to define "right-side view" in the context of the tree traversal?<br>3. I see you are using queue data structure for your solution here. Could you explain why you chose this data structure? What are the advantages of using a queue in this context?<br>4.There are several ways to traverse a tree, such as: preorder, inorder, postorder and breadth-first traversal. Could you tell me why you chose breadth-first traversal (BFS) for this problem over depth-first traversal (DFS)? What are the pros and cons of both?<br>5. Can you talk about the time complexity of this approach? How would the size of the binary tree affect execution time? |

| GPT-4 is much more complete and the phrasing of gpt-4’s answers seem much more in context as an interviewer. Both models ask relevant questions with regard to the algorithms being used - BFS.           |

Example 2:

| You are an interviewer for a technical role.<br><br>I am solving the following question: Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes’ values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level). examples: Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]] <br><br>This is my current code: public List<List<Integer>> levelOrder(TreeNode root) {List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>(); if (root == null) {return result;} Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();queue.add(root); while (!queue.isEmpty()) {int size = queue.size(); ArrayList<Integer> level = new ArrayList<>();<br><br>based on my incomplete solution, ask me some questions regarding my solution, or ask me some related data structures and algorithms questions|

|-----------------|----------------|
| Great! It looks like you have started with a good approach using a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here are some follow-up questions to help you improve your understanding:<br>Can you explain why we need to use a queue in this problem? What does it represent?<br>How do you ensure that each node is visited only once during the traversal?<br>In the line int size = queue.size(), what is the purpose of storing the size of the queue at that point?<br>Why did you choose to create a new list called "level" inside the loop? Is there another way to implement this without creating a separate list?<br>Can you think of any edge cases where your implementation might not work correctly? For example, what happens if the input tree has cycles or contains duplicate nodes? | 1. Could you explain how you plan to use the queue data structure in your solution?<br>2. How is the size of the queue helping you in keeping track of the nodes at each level?<br>3. I see you have initialized an ArrayList named ’level’. How are you planning to use this in your logic?<br>4. Generally speaking, which traversal technique (Breadth-first or Depth-first) is your algorithm based on?<br>5. Can you explain why you check for ’root == null’ at the beginning of the function.|

Example 3:
| Example 3 Query |
|-----------------|
| You are an interviewer for a technical role. I am solving the following question: There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station’s index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique. Examples: Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2] Output: 3 Explanation: Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4 Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8 Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7 Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6 Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5 Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3. Therefore, return 3 as the starting index. <br><br>This is my current code:public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) { int n = gas.length; int totalDiff = 0; int[] diff = new int[n]; for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {diff[i] = gas[i] - cost[i];totalDiff += diff[i];}if (totalDiff < 0) {return -1;} <br><br>based on my incomplete solution, ask me some questions regarding my solution, or ask me some related data structures and algorithms questions. Limit your total questions to 5.|

| Code Llama      | GPT-4          |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Sure! Let’s start by discussing your current solution.<br>It looks like you’ve calculated the net gain or loss of gas at each station, and stored them in the diff array. Then, you’ve checked whether the sum of all these differences is less than zero. If so, you’ve returned -1, indicating that it’s not possible to complete the circuit.<br>However, I don’t see any logic to determine which starting point would allow us to complete the circuit. Could you elaborate on how you plan to find the starting point?<br>Additionally, I want to clarify that we need to find the starting point such that we can complete the entire circuit exactly once, without running out of gas. So, we need to ensure that our chosen starting point allows us to cover all the remaining stations after visiting each one, until we reach the starting point again.<br>Finally, I’d like to know more about the constraints of this problem. Are there any limitations on the values of gas and cost? For example, could they contain negative numbers, or very large integers? How big could n be? Knowing these details will help us come up with a more efficient and robust solution.| 1. I can see you have used an array ’diff’ to store the difference of gas and cost for all the stations and then you summed up all the differences into ’totalDiff’. What is the significance of totalDiff and what are you trying to achieve by summing up all differences?<br>2. Your solution currently checks if the total difference is negative and returns -1 in that case. However, how do you plan to find the starting station’s index if the total difference is not negative?<br>3. According to your code, if the totalDiff value is negative, then it is not possible to complete the circuit. What assumption are you making in your code that justify this approach?<br>4. What kind of data structure or algorithm would you apply next to identify the starting gas station after the totalDiff check?<br>5. Can you talk about the time complexity and space complexity of your current solution, and what improvements you could make in this area for your solution?|

| Example 3 Evaluation |
|----------------------|
|GPT-4 asks relevant questions about the differences in diff and totalDiff, and also checks how the interviewee is planning to find the gas station index if total difference is not negative. Relevant questions like time complexity and space complexity are also asked. Code Llama correctly asks how we plan to continue solving this problem, by finding the starting point (which was not yet implemented in the solution). Code Llama does not ask about data structure/ algorithms, and neither does it ask about time complexity. I think GPT-4 is the winner. Code llama is not as complete.         |

The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

|-----------------|----------------|
| Sure! Here are some questions and topics related to your solution:<br><br>What is the time complexity of your solution? Can you optimize it further?<br>How does your solution handle negative numbers? Does it work correctly for all possible inputs?<br>Can you explain the intuition behind your implementation of the GCD function? Why did you choose to implement it recursively?<br>In the worst case scenario, what is the maximum number of times the GCD function will be called for a given input? Can you think of any optimization techniques to reduce the number of calls?<br>How would you test your solution to ensure it works correctly for all possible inputs? Do you have any specific test cases in mind?<br>These are just some examples of questions and topics related to your solution. Feel free to share your thoughts and ideas, and I’ll provide feedback and guidance accordingly. | 1. The gcd function in your solution uses the Euclidean algorithm. Can you explain how this algorithm works in calculating the greatest common divisor of two numbers?<br>2. Your code is iterating over the linked list using curNode but isn’t performing any operation yet. Can you explain your approach? How are you planning to add the new nodes?<br>3. I notice that your approach relies heavily on the ListNode structure. How familiar are you with others like doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, or platform implemented structures like List or LinkedList in Java?<br>4. Can you tell me about the time complexity of your solution? How would you optimize your solution if the size of the linked list is very large?<br>5. How would your current solution handle the edge case in which the linked list is empty or contains only a single element? Would you need to add any checks or conditions for this?|

| Example 4 Evaluation |
|----------------------|
|GPT-4 asks a question related to the data structure being used (ListNode which is a singly-linked list), and asked about knowledge of other types of lists. This could be useful. The interrupt to ask about the implementation within the while loop is quite good, as it is a relevant time to question the interviewee about his approach.       |

Example 5:
| Example 5 Query |
|-----------------|
| You are an interviewer for a technical role. I am solving the following question: Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant extra space. <br><br>This is my current code: class Solution {public List<Integer> findDuplicates(int[] nums) {List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(); HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();<br><br>based on my incomplete solution, ask me some questions regarding my solution, or ask me some related data structures and algorithms questions. Limit your total questions to 5.|

 | Code Llama      | GPT-4          |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Sure! Let’s take a look at your current solution.<br><br>You’ve initialized a HashSet to keep track of the numbers we’ve already seen, which is a great way to check for duplicates in linear time. But we don’t actually need to store the entire number in the set – we just need to remember its presence. So instead of storing the actual number, we can simply store a flag indicating whether we’ve seen it before.<br><br>Here’s a modified version of your code with this change: *Code block*<br>Now, let’s talk about the time complexity of our solution. We iterate through the input array once, and for each element, we perform a lookup operation in the HashSet. The total time complexity is therefore O(n), where n is the size of the input array.<br><br>Can you see any ways to further optimize our solution? Hints: Think about the properties of the input array and how they might help us avoid unnecessary work. | 1. Your current solution seems to use a HashSet which will not adhere to the constraint of using only constant extra space since the size of the HashSet can grow with the input. Do you have a plan to adapt your solution to fit this constraint?<br>2. When choosing your data structure for this problem, why did you initially go for a HashSet? What are the benefits and downsides of using a HashSet?<br>3. Can you suggest an alternative method that might possibly adhere to the given constraints of time complexity O(n) and constant space? <br>4. Given the property that the integers of nums are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice, what approach can you use to identify the duplicate numbers without the need for more space?<br>5. Can you think of a single pass solution, and if you can, what operations and data manipulations would you need to perform in order to find and return the duplicates?|

| Example 5 Evaluation |
|----------------------|
|GPT-4 gave a much better response. It noticed that the question is asking us for constant space, and the use of HashSet will not adhere to the requirements. It prompts the interviewee to think of a one pass solution, along with operations and manipulations that will allow us to adhere to constant space. It also asks us about the benefits and downsides of using HashSet, which is a relevant data structure question. GPT-4 wins!      |

Example 6:

| You are an interviewer for a technical role. I am solving the following question: There are n people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a unique ID from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer array groupSizes, where groupSizes[i] is the size of the group that person i is in. For example, if groupSizes[1] = 3, then person 1 must be in a group of size 3. Return a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupSizes[i]. Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input. <br><br>This is my current code: class Solution {public List<List<Integer>> groupThePeople(int[] groupSizes) {List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();for (int i = 0; i < groupSizes.length; i++) {if (!map.containsKey(groupSizes[i])) {ArrayList<Integer> lst = new ArrayList<>();lst.add(i);map.put(groupSizes[i], lst);} else {map.get(groupSizes[i]).add(i);}}<br><br>based on my incomplete solution, ask me some questions regarding my solution, or ask me some related data structures and algorithms questions. Limit your total questions to 5.|

 | Code Llama      | GPT-4          |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Great! Let’s start by reviewing your current approach.<br>You are using a HashMap to keep track of the sizes of the groups and the indices of the people who belong to those groups. This seems like a good starting point.<br>However, I notice that you are only adding the index of the person to the list associated with their group size. But we also need to make sure that each person appears in exactly one group, and that no person belongs to multiple groups. To achieve this, we could modify our logic to add the actual person object instead of just their index.<br>Additionally, it looks like you are not handling the case where a person does not fit into any existing group. In this situation, we would need to create a new group specifically for that person.<br>Can you think of a way to address these issues and complete the problem?| 1. I see that you have successfully assigned individuals to groups according to their group size. However, how do you plan on addressing the requirement that mandates each group to contain exactly groupSizes[i] number of individuals?<br>2. Can you explain how a HashMap is helping you in this problem? Specifically, what are the key and value in your map, and why did you choose to use a HashMap?<br>3. You are adding individuals to a group until the group is full (reaches the defined group size). How are you planning to handle the situation when a group is complete? How will you handle the overflow individuals?<br>4. What is the time complexity of your current approach? Are there any ways that you could optimize your solution?<br>5. Can you explain how your solution would handle edge cases, for example, if all individuals belonged to a group size that is greater than 1 i.e., there are no individuals who belong to a group of size 1?|

| Example 6 Evaluation |
|----------------------|
|Both Code Llama and GPT-4 understood what the current block of code is doing: to assign individuals to group according to their group sizes. Code Llama’s observation to use a person object is incorrect. GPT-4’s answer is much better, asking questions about the HashMap and also asking the interviewee to explain the key value pairs, to check their understanding. It also asks how the interviewee is planning to complete the second part of the question in point 3.     |

Example 7:

| You are an interviewer for a technical role. I am solving the following question: You are given an integer array pref of size n. Find and return the array arr of size n that satisfies: pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i]. Note that ^ denotes the bitwise-xor operation. It can be proven that the answer is unique. <br><br>This is my current code: class Solution {public int[] findArray(int[] pref) {int[] prefixArray = new int[pref.length];prefixArray[0] = pref[0];for (int i = 1; i < pref.length; i++) {<br><br>based on my incomplete solution, ask me some questions regarding my solution, or ask me some related data structures and algorithms questions.

 | Code Llama      | GPT-4          |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Great! Let’s start with some clarifying questions about your approach:<br>Can you explain why you chose to use a prefix sum array instead of simply iterating over the input array? What benefits does this approach provide in terms of time complexity?<br>How do you handle edge cases such as negative numbers or zeroes in the input array? Does your algorithm account for these possibilities?<br>In the line "prefixArray[0] = pref[0];", what is the purpose of setting the first element of the output array equal to the first element of the input array? Is it necessary for the correctness of the algorithm?<br>Can you describe the intuition behind using the XOR operator to solve this problem? How did you come up with this idea?| 1. What is the approach you’re planning to use to complete the function according to given requirements?<br>2. Your code uses a bitwise XOR operation. Can you explain why it is useful in this particular scenario?<br>3. Currently, your solution copies the first element from pref array to prefixArray and then seems to iterate over the range from 1 to length of pref. What operation(s) are you planning to perform inside the for loop? <br>4. In addition to bitwise operations, what other data structures or algorithms do you think would help solve this problem more efficiently or alternatively? <br>5. How would you take advantage of the properties of XOR operation, specifically the fact that `A XOR A = 0` and `A XOR 0 = A`, in the context of this problem? |

| Example 7 Evaluation |
|----------------------|
|Code Llama asks about the choice of using a prefix array, and whether it will help in terms of time complexity, and also asks about setting the first element of the prefix array. These are relevant questions. In particular, Code Llama also asks about the intuition behind using the xor operator to solve this problem, which is very relevant, and encourages the interviewee to share the property of xor that will help to solve this problem.<br>GPT-4 asks how the interviewee plans to complete the rest of the question, and also asks about the operations to be performed in the for loop, and also asks about the usage of bitwise xor, similar to code llama. In this case, i think it is a draw. |

Example 8:

| You are an interviewer for a technical role. Iind all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:Only numbers 1 through 9 are used. Each number is used at most once. Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order. <br><br>This is my current code: class Solution {public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum3(int k, int n) {List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();combination(ans, new ArrayList<Integer>(), k, 1, n);return ans;}private void combination(List<List<Integer>> ans, List<Integer> comb, int k,  int start, int n) {if (comb.size() == k && n == 0) {<br><br>based on my solution, ask me some questions regarding my solution, or ask me some related data structures and algorithms questions. Limit your total questions to 5.|

 | Code Llama      | GPT-4          |
|-----------------|----------------|
| This is a good start! Here are some follow-up questions to help us better understand your thought process and coding skills:<br>Can you explain the logic behind your combination method? How does it ensure that only valid combinations are added to the result list?<br>Why do you need both k and start parameters in the combination method signature? How do they relate to each other?<br>Your code uses a recursive approach to generate all possible combinations. Have you considered alternative approaches, such as dynamic programming or backtracking? If so, which one would you prefer and why?<br>How would you optimize your code for large inputs? For example, could you reduce the number of recursive calls or avoid generating duplicate combinations?<br>Finally, how confident are you in your ability to write efficient and scalable code like this under timed pressure during an interview? | 11. I can see that you are missing some code in the condition where comb.size() == k && n == 0. How will you fill that condition, what logic are you planning to use there?<br>2. What is the role of the ’start’ parameter in your combination method?<br>3. If your combinations have more than ’k’ elements and the current sum is less than ’n’, what will be the base case to return? <br>4. Can you elaborate on the time complexity and space complexity of your solution?<br>5. How does the use of recursion in your solution help in finding all valid combinations? Can you explain the recursive step?|

| Example 8 Evaluation |
|----------------------|
|Code Llama asks how the recursive combination method works, and also asks a relevant question as to whether DP is possible in solving the question. GPT-4 asks 5 relevant questions, to explain the recursive step, base case, time complexity, use of the start parameter in the recursive call, and how to complete the recursive solution. Because of the completeness of GPT-4’s questions, I think GPT-4 wins.   |
