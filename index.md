| Great! It looks like you’re working on a problem that involves traversing a binary tree. Here are some follow-up questions to help you solidify your understanding: <br>Can you explain the purpose of using a queue in this problem? How does it help us traverse the tree?<br>What is the difference between breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS)? When might we use one over the other?<br>In BFS, how do we ensure that we visit all the nodes at each level before moving on to the next level?<br>If we were to modify our algorithm to print out the left view instead of the right view, what changes would we need to make?<br>Can you think of any edge cases that could arise when implementing this algorithm? For example, what happens if there are multiple nodes with the same value in the tree? | 1. Can you please explain how your current solution works? <br>2. Please walk me through your approach for finding the right-side view of the binary tree. How are you planning to define "right-side view" in the context of the tree traversal?<br>3. I see you are using queue data structure for your solution here. Could you explain why you chose this data structure? What are the advantages of using a queue in this context?<br>4.There are several ways to traverse a tree, such as: preorder, inorder, postorder and breadth-first traversal. Could you tell me why you chose breadth-first traversal (BFS) for this problem over depth-first traversal (DFS)? What are the pros and cons of both?<br>5. Can you talk about the time complexity of this approach? How would the size of the binary tree affect execution time? |

| GPT-4 is much more complete and the phrasing of gpt-4’s answers seem much more in context as an interviewer. Both models ask relevant questions with regard to the algorithms being used - BFS.           |

| You are an interviewer for a technical role.<br><br>I am solving the following question: Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes’ values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level). examples: Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]] <br><br>This is my current code: public List<List<Integer>> levelOrder(TreeNode root) {List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>(); if (root == null) {return result;} Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();queue.add(root); while (!queue.isEmpty()) {int size = queue.size(); ArrayList<Integer> level = new ArrayList<>();<br><br>based on my incomplete solution, ask me some questions regarding my solution, or ask me some related data structures and algorithms questions|

| Great! It looks like you have started with a good approach using a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here are some follow-up questions to help you improve your understanding:<br>Can you explain why we need to use a queue in this problem? What does it represent?<br>How do you ensure that each node is visited only once during the traversal?<br>In the line int size = queue.size(), what is the purpose of storing the size of the queue at that point?<br>Why did you choose to create a new list called "level" inside the loop? Is there another way to implement this without creating a separate list?<br>Can you think of any edge cases where your implementation might not work correctly? For example, what happens if the input tree has cycles or contains duplicate nodes? | 1. Could you explain how you plan to use the queue data structure in your solution?<br>2. How is the size of the queue helping you in keeping track of the nodes at each level?<br>3. I see you have initialized an ArrayList named ’level’. How are you planning to use this in your logic?<br>4. Generally speaking, which traversal technique (Breadth-first or Depth-first) is your algorithm based on?<br>5. Can you explain why you check for ’root == null’ at the beginning of the function.|

Example 3:
| Example 3 Query |
|-----------------|
| You are an interviewer for a technical role. I am solving the following question: There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station’s index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique. Examples: Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2] Output: 3 Explanation: Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4 Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8 Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7 Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6 Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5 Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3. Therefore, return 3 as the starting index. <br><br>This is my current code:public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) { int n = gas.length; int totalDiff = 0; int[] diff = new int[n]; for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {diff[i] = gas[i] - cost[i];totalDiff += diff[i];}if (totalDiff < 0) {return -1;} <br><br>based on my incomplete solution, ask me some questions regarding my solution, or ask me some related data structures and algorithms questions. Limit your total questions to 5.|

| Sure! Let’s start by discussing your current solution.<br>It looks like you’ve calculated the net gain or loss of gas at each station, and stored them in the diff array. Then, you’ve checked whether the sum of all these differences is less than zero. If so, you’ve returned -1, indicating that it’s not possible to complete the circuit.<br>However, I don’t see any logic to determine which starting point would allow us to complete the circuit. Could you elaborate on how you plan to find the starting point?<br>Additionally, I want to clarify that we need to find the starting point such that we can complete the entire circuit exactly once, without running out of gas. So, we need to ensure that our chosen starting point allows us to cover all the remaining stations after visiting each one, until we reach the starting point again.<br>Finally, I’d like to know more about the constraints of this problem. Are there any limitations on the values of gas and cost? For example, could they contain negative numbers, or very large integers? How big could n be? Knowing these details will help us come up with a more efficient and robust solution.| 1. I can see you have used an array ’diff’ to store the difference of gas and cost for all the stations and then you summed up all the differences into ’totalDiff’. What is the significance of totalDiff and what are you trying to achieve by summing up all differences?<br>2. Your solution currently checks if the total difference is negative and returns -1 in that case. However, how do you plan to find the starting station’s index if the total difference is not negative?<br>3. According to your code, if the totalDiff value is negative, then it is not possible to complete the circuit. What assumption are you making in your code that justify this approach?<br>4. What kind of data structure or algorithm would you apply next to identify the starting gas station after the totalDiff check?<br>5. Can you talk about the time complexity and space complexity of your current solution, and what improvements you could make in this area for your solution?|

|GPT-4 asks relevant questions about the differences in diff and totalDiff, and also checks how the interviewee is planning to find the gas station index if total difference is not negative. Relevant questions like time complexity and space complexity are also asked. Code Llama correctly asks how we plan to continue solving this problem, by finding the starting point (which was not yet implemented in the solution). Code Llama does not ask about data structure/ algorithms, and neither does it ask about time complexity. I think GPT-4 is the winner. Code llama is not as complete.         |
