| You are an interviewer for a technical role. I am solving the following question: Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom. Examples: Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4] Output: [1,3,4] 
This is my current code: public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) { List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>(); if (root == null) { return res; } Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>(); queue.add(root); while (!queue.isEmpty()) { int size = queue.size(); 

based on my incomplete solution, ask me some questions regarding my solution, or ask me some related data structures and algorithms questions. Limit your total questions to 5.

| Great! It looks like you’re working on a problem that involves traversing a binary tree. Here are some follow-up questions to help you solidify your understanding:
Can you explain the purpose of using a queue in this problem? How does it help us traverse the tree?
What is the difference between breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS)? When might we use one over the other?
In BFS, how do we ensure that we visit all the nodes at each level before moving on to the next level?
If we were to modify our algorithm to print out the left view instead of the right view, what changes would we need to make?
Can you think of any edge cases that could arise when implementing this algorithm? For example, what happens if there are multiple nodes with the same value in the tree?
| 1. Can you please explain how your current solution works? 
2. Please walk me through your approach for finding the right-side view of the binary tree. How are you planning to define "right-side view" in the context of the tree traversal?
3. I see you are using queue data structure for your solution here. Could you explain why you chose this data structure? What are the advantages of using a queue in this context?
4.There are several ways to traverse a tree, such as: preorder, inorder, postorder and breadth-first traversal. Could you tell me why you chose breadth-first traversal (BFS) for this problem over depth-first traversal (DFS)? What are the pros and cons of both?
5. Can you talk about the time complexity of this approach? How would the size of the binary tree affect execution time? |

| GPT-4 is much more complete and the phrasing of gpt-4’s answers seem much more in context as an interviewer. Both models ask relevant questions with regard to the algorithms being used - BFS.           |
